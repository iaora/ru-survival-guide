# Why Computer Science?

At the department of Computer Science at Rutgers University, we strive for excellence in undergraduate education. Our undergraduate program offers a solid foundation in software, systems and theory while offering elective courses in Artificial Intelligence, Internet Technologies, Databases, Graphics and more.&#x20;

We offer undergraduate students the opportunity to participate in cutting edge research and also provide students with newly designed collaborative computer labs and maker spaces. Undergraduates also have the opportunity to get involved with our many University CS affiliated clubs.

### Computer Science majors will..&#x20;

* be prepared to contribute to a rapidly changing field by acquiring a thorough grounding in the core principles and foundations of computer science (e.g., techniques of program design, creation, and testing; key aspects of computer hardware; algorithmic principles).
* acquire a deeper understanding on (elective) topics of more specialized interest, and be able to critically review, assess, and communicate current developments in the field.
* be prepared for the next step in their careers, for example, by having done a research project (for those headed to graduate school), a programming project (for those going into the software industry), or some sort of business plan (for those going into startups).
