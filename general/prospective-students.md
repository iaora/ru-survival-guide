### Majoring in Computer Science can take you where you want to go!

The Computer Science (CS) Department was established at Rutgers in 1966. Programs leading to a Bachelor's degree in computer science are offered by the undergraduate colleges at Rutgers. The faculty of the department are members of the School of Arts and Sciences.&#x20;

The Graduate Program in Computer Science, which is a program in the Graduate School, offers courses of study leading to an M.Sc. or a Ph.D. in computer science.&#x20;

The graduate and undergraduate programs are highly ranked by the US News & World Report for computer science rankings and CS Rankings which are based on faculty research publications. A recent Washington Post study found that computer science majors earn the highest median based salary amongst all college majors.
