* Computer Science 105, 107, 110, 170 or 405 cannot be credited toward a minor in computer science. Only courses that count toward the major may be counted toward the minor.
* No more than one D will be accepted in courses taken toward the minor.
* Residency condition: At least five of the courses used to satisfy the requirements of the minor must be courses taken in the New Brunswick Department of Computer Science. (These courses must be 01:198:xxx.)

* Please note that courses for which a student receives a grade of D cannot be used to satisfy prerequisite requirements.
* CS minors cannot take graduate classes unless they have completed all the requirements of the minor. Requirements to register for CS graduate classes is available on the [CS Honors ](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/academics/undergraduate/cs-degrees/cs-honors-program)page.
